# Cutie Hack 2020 -- Quarantine Survival
Authors: [Jeffrey Hata](https://github.com/Jeff591) and [Cameron Fong](https://github.com/CameronSF)

## Project Description
Quarantine Survival is text based game where two people named Perone and Twoson have to survive quarantine and be able to make it through 30 weeks of quarantine alive. To do this, they are given the chance to buy whatever items they need at the beginning using a set amount of money they have. However after this shopping period is over, they will manage the items they bought as they face different random events and challenges over the next 30 weeks. Each week you will keep track of your items, character health and status, and have the ability to go out and find resources. 

This project was created in C++ using VS code and the project can be run within the terminal/command line. This project won the Best Beginner Hack award at UCR's Cutie Hack 2020.
